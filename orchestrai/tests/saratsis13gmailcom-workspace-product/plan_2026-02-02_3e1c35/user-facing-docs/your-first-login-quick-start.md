# Your First Login - Quick Start

Welcome! This guide will walk you through logging into your application for the first time and exploring what you can do. By the end, you'll know how to access your dashboard and start managing users and items.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure your application is running. If you followed the installation guide, your application should be accessible in your web browser.

## Step 1: Access Your Application

Open your web browser and navigate to your application's address. If you're running it locally on your computer, this is typically:

```
http://localhost
```

You should see a clean login screen welcoming you to the application.

## Step 2: Log In With Your Admin Account

When the application was first set up, an administrator account was automatically created for you. Use these credentials to log in:

- **Email**: The email address you specified during setup (default: `admin@example.com`)
- **Password**: The password you specified during setup (default: `changethis`)

> **Important Security Note**: If you're using the default password `changethis`, you should change it immediately after your first login. Never use default passwords in a real environment.

Enter your email and password, then click the login button.

## Step 3: Welcome to Your Dashboard

After logging in successfully, you'll see your main dashboard. This is your command center where you can manage everything in your application.

The dashboard shows you:

- **Navigation menu**: Located on the side, giving you quick access to different sections
- **Main content area**: Where you'll see information and perform tasks
- **User menu**: Usually in the top corner, where you can access your settings

### What You Can Do From Here

As an administrator, you have access to powerful features:

#### Manage Users

Navigate to the Users section to:
- View all users in your system
- Create new user accounts
- Edit existing user information
- Remove users when needed

Click on "Users" in the navigation menu to see everyone who has access to your application.

#### Manage Items

Navigate to the Items section to:
- View all items in your system
- Create new items
- Edit or update existing items
- Delete items you no longer need

Items are the core data objects in your application that users can create and manage.

#### Update Your Settings

Navigate to User Settings to:
- Change your password
- Update your profile information
- Adjust your preferences

## Step 4: Try Creating Your First User

Let's complete a simple task to get comfortable with the interface:

1. **Navigate to Users**: Click on the Users option in the navigation menu
2. **Click the Create Button**: Look for a button to add a new user
3. **Fill in the Details**: Enter an email address and password for the new user
4. **Save**: Click the save or create button to add them to your system

You've just created your first user! You'll see them appear in your users list.

## Understanding the Interface

### Light and Dark Modes

The application supports both light and dark display modes. Look for a theme toggle (usually a sun/moon icon) to switch between them based on your preference.

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to your screen size. Whether you're using a desktop computer, tablet, or phone, the dashboard will adjust to provide the best experience.

## What's Next?

Now that you've logged in and explored the basics, you can:

- **Create more users** to give others access to the application
- **Add items** to start building your data
- **Explore the interactive API documentation** (if you're technically inclined)
- **Customize your profile** in the user settings

## Common Questions

**Q: I forgot my password. What do I do?**  
Look for a "Forgot Password" or "Reset Password" link on the login screen. You'll receive an email with instructions to reset it.

**Q: Can I change the default administrator email?**  
Yes! You set this during initial setup. If you need to change it, you'll need to update your configuration settings.

**Q: What if I can't access the application URL?**  
Make sure the application is running. Check with your system administrator or refer to the installation guide to ensure all services started correctly.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
Yes! The application uses secure password hashing and JWT authentication to protect your information. However, make sure you're using strong passwords and have changed any default credentials.

## Troubleshooting

**Login screen not loading**: Verify the application is running and you're using the correct URL.

**Invalid credentials error**: Double-check your email and password. Remember that passwords are case-sensitive.

**Dashboard looks broken or incomplete**: Try refreshing your browser or clearing your browser cache.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during your first login:

1. Verify all application services are running properly
2. Check that you're using the correct credentials
3. Ensure your web browser is up to date
4. Consult your system administrator if you're part of an organization

Congratulations! You've successfully completed your first login and are ready to start using your application. Take some time to explore the different sections and familiarize yourself with the interface.
