```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';

// Mock localStorage
const localStorageMock = {
  getItem: jest.fn(),
  setItem: jest.fn(),
  removeItem: jest.fn(),
  clear: jest.fn(),
};
global.localStorage = localStorageMock;

// Mock window.fetch
global.fetch = jest.fn();

// Silence console errors during tests
console.error = jest.fn();
```

These test files provide a solid foundation for testing the core functionality of the frontend application. They cover:

1. Authentication provider and context
2. Authentication service
3. Protected route component
4. Proper Jest configuration
5. Test setup with mocks

To achieve 100% coverage, you would need to:

1. Add more component tests for all React components
2. Test all service classes
3. Test utility functions
4. Add integration tests for complex workflows
5. Test error boundaries and error handling
6. Test hooks and custom hooks

Would you like me to generate additional test files for specific components or services?
